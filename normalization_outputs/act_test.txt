Original ratio of meas_act/calc_act for each foils is:
foil,	meas act,	calc act,	 meas/calc
Fe54,	1.93E-14,	4.08E-14,	0.4732
Fe56,	2.66E-16,	4.88E-16,	0.5454
Fe58,	3.99E-12,	7.26E-12,	0.5494

Average meas_act/calc_act before normalization is:  0.5227
Average thermal ratio:  0.5494
Average fission ratio:  0.5093

Adjusted normalization so new ratio is 1.0.
The activity values and ratio for foils are now:
foil,	meas act,	calc act,	 meas/calc
Fe54,	1.93E-14,	2.08E-14,	0.9291
Fe56,	2.66E-16,	2.48E-16,	1.0709
Fe58,	3.99E-12,	3.99E-12,	1.0000

Average ratio after normalization is:  1.0000

Normalized 1 MeV equivalence is:  3.66E+11 n/cm^2/s

New function parameters are:
Thermal:	2.91E-12
Intermediate:	1.18E-13
Fission:	1.18E-13
Thermal-Interm Connection:	1.47E-07
Interm-Fission Connection:	5.00E-01
